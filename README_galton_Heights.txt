Linear Models
Run a linear model for sons’ heights vs. fathers’ heights using the Galton height data, and interpret the numeric coefficient for "father."


LSE are Random Variables
We run a Monte Carlo simulation where we repeatedly take samples of N = 100 from the Galton heights data and compute the regression slope coefficients for each sample: 
What does the central limit theorem tell us about the variables beta_0 and beta_1?



Predicted Variables are Random Variables
Which R code(s) would properly plot the predictions and confidence intervals for our linear model of sons’ heights?
