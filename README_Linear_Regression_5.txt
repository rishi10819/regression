Create a data set.
y should be correlated with both x_1 and x_2.
x_1 and x_2 are highly correlated.
Partition into a test and training set of equal size. 
Compare the RMSE when using just x_1, just x_2 and both x_1 and x_2. 
Train a linear model for each.
Which of the three models performs the best (has the lowest RMSE)?
What is the lowest RMSE of the three models?
